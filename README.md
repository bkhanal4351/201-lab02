## About Me, with a guessing game

I build a page with information about me, as well as JavaScript prompts for page visitors to be assessed on their initial knowledge of me before reading the page content. They receive 7 questions (some built use loops and arrays) and ultimately receive a personalized final message congratulating them on completing the game and giving them their final score based off how many questions they answered correctly.
